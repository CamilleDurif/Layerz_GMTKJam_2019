# Layerz_GMTKJam_2019

LayerZZZ is a submission to the 2019 GMTKJam. For the theme « Only one », we decided to make a game in which you only see one information at a time. 

Shoot your way through this procedurally generated level to find the switch who opens the boss room. 

Controls : 

-  ZQSD/WASD to move
- Press TAB to switch between layers (enemies, environment , health, ammunition, pause)
- Left click to shoot when on enemies and environment layers / heal on health layer / reload on ammunition layer / pause and unpause on pause layer
